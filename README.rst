socket.io-python-emitter
========================

A Python implementation of `socket.io-emitter <https://github.com/automattic/socket.io-emitter>`_.

`socket.io <http://socket.io/>`_ provides a hook point to easily allow you to emit events to browsers from anywhere so `socket.io-python-emitter` communicates with `socket.io <http://socket.io/>`_ servers through redis.

We made some changes, compatible socket.io-redis 0.2.0 and socket.io 0.1.4.

How to use
----------

**Install via pip**
  
  pip install socket.io-emitter

.. code-block:: python

  import emitter from Emitter
  io=Emitter({'host': 'localhost', 'port':6379})
  io.Emit('broadcast event','Hello from socket.io-python-emitter')

API
---

Emitter(opts)
-------------

The following options are allowed:

- `client`: is a `redis-py <https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py>`_ compatible client
   This argument is optional.
- `key`: the name of the key to pub/sub events on as prefix (`socket.io`)
- `host`: host to connect to redis on (`localhost`)
- `port`: port to connect to redis on (`6379`)

If you don't want to supply a redis client object, and want
`socket.io-python-emitter` to initialize one for you, make sure to supply the
`host` and `port` options.

Specifies a specific `room` that you want to emit to.

Emitter#In(room):Emitter
------------------------

.. code-black:: python

  io=Emitter({'host': 'localhost', 'port':6379})
  io.In("room-name").Emit("news","Hello from python emitter");

Emitter#To(room):Emitter
------------------------

.. code-black:: python

 io=Emitter({'host': 'localhost', 'port':6379})
    
 io.To("room-name").Emit("news","Hello from python emitter");

We are flattening the room parameter from [] and *argv, so you can also send to several rooms like this (both examples are valid):

.. code-black:: python

 io=Emitter({'host': 'localhost', 'port':6379})

 io.To(["room1", "room2"]).Emit("news","Hello from python emitter");
 io.To("room1", "room2").Emit("news","Hello from python emitter");

Emitter#Of(namespace):Emitter
-----------------------------

Specifies a specific namespace that you want to emit to.

.. code-black:: python

 io=Emitter({'host': 'localhost', 'port':6379})
    
 io.Of("/nsp").In("room-name").Emit("news","Hello from python emitter");
